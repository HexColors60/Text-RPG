# Text RPG

Source code for my C++ Text-based RPG style game.

I built this repository to learn and practice my C++ skills. I will try to add as much features as I can.

Use cmake to built the repository. If you use Visual Studio, you will need to copy the assets and data directory to the executable folder.

I did not test the project build on Mac. Maybe you will need to change the CMakeLists file accordingly.

Last but not least, this project uses JSON for Modern C++. The file is already inside the project so you don't need to download it.
