# Tower Of God

Source code for my C++ Text-based RPG style game.

I built this repository to learn and practice my C++ skills. I will try to add as much features as I can.

My aim is to build a game which will closely resemble the manga Tower Of God.

This project uses JSON for Modern C++ for JSON manipulation. The file is already inside the project so you don't need to download it.
